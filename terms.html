	<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
	<p>While they are not legally required, terms and conditions set the stage for any successful business relationship, by making it clear and putting these guidelines in writing, business owners can avoid misunderstandings with their customers.

	It also allows you to decide what you consider acceptable and which type of conduct could lead you to terminate a relationship with a user.

	For example, if you have rules as to what type of user-generated content can be shared on your website and someone posts something that goes against these, then you would have a leg to stand out should you decide to take that content down.

	It can also help you limit your liability in regards to some situations, which could reduce the likelihood of facing lawsuits or reduce the damages that you would have to pay should it be demonstrated that your user was aware and had agreed to your terms.

	In other words, when drafted properly, it allows you to maintain ownership and control over your product (website or application) and can help in maintaining a positive and pleasant relationship with your users as they will be aware of what constitutes acceptable behavior.

	Not only that, it can address a lot of the questions that users may have and for which they would have reached out to you for an answer, effectively saving you time and resources.</p>
